<p>
In order to calculate metrics for a team and its service components and sub-components,
you will need to attach and configure collectors for the systems that are used by that 
team/service component/service sub-component.
<br/>
This help page will tell you how the collectors work and how it should be attached and configured.
</br>
It is recommended that you read this entire help and make sure you understand it properly before 
going ahead with the configuration.
</p>

<p>
To get data for the metrics calculation at the service sub-component level, collectors needs 
to be attached at the service sub-component level. Although collectors can also be attached at 
the service component and at team level too. But in these later cases data will be mapped and 
metrics calculated at the service component and team level respectively.
</p>

<p>
The following collectors are required for the various DORA metrics at any level (service sub-component/service component/team):
<br/>
<b>Deployment Frequency</b> - At least one collector listed under cicd.<br/>
<b>Lead Time for Changes</b> - At least one collector listed under cicd + At least one collector listed under repository.<br/>
<b>Mean Time to Restore</b> - At least one collector listed under incident.<br/>
<b>Change Failure Rate</b> - At least one collector listed under incident + At least one collector listed under cicd.<br/>
<br/>
A single collector at a level will pull data for all the metrics requiring that collector. 
For example, configuring one cicd collector at a service sub-component level will pull data 
to calculate Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes and Change Failure Rate at that level.
<br/>
Metrics at a higher level is an aggregation of all the levels below it. So, if you configure 
the collectors at the service sub-component level of a service component, the metrics of the 
service component will be calculated from the data pulled for its corresponding service sub-components. 
You SHOULD NOT configure collectors for the service component seperately if you have configured the 
collectors for its constituent sub-components.

Steps to attach collectors:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>
In the left hand side Team and Services area, select the service sub-component to which you wish to 
attach the collectors. (You may select the service component or team also to attach at a different level).
</li>
<li>
On the right hand side area, click the 'Add collectors' button and click the type of system to see the 
available collectors.
</li>
<li>
Click the collector that you wish to attach. The name of the collector tells you the system that it 
will connect to.
</li>
<li>
This will add a collector configuration box. Click on the box to expand and configure the collector.
</li>
<li>
The default configuration used by your organization for the system is prefilled in the configuration 
box, in case your administrator has configured the defaults.
</li>
<li>
Fill in the url and authorization information for the system or change the default values already filled.
</li>
<li>
Click the 'Connect to Server' button to test the url and authorization information and get the complete 
list of options available to fill in the remaining fields in the configuration box.
</li>
<li>
Choose or type in the appropriate values of all the remaining fields as applicable for the selected 
service sub-component/service component/team. Alternatively you can opt to retain the defaults if 
they are set.
</li>
<li>
The explaination about what each of the fields mean are given just below each field. In case of any 
confusion, refer to the detailed help on wiki or contact your system administrator.
</li>
<li>
Click on the header of the configuration box to collapse the box.
</li>
<li>
You can remove a wrongly attached collector by clicking on the cross icon on the header of the 
collector's configuration box.
</li>
<li>
You can temporarily pause the attached collector from collecting data by deselecting the enable 
checkbox on the header of the collector's configuration box. Select the enable checkbox to resume 
collecting data.
</li>
<li>
Once you have attached and configured all the required collectors for the team and it's various 
services, click on the SAVE button below the Team and Services area to save the entire collection 
of collectors configurations.<br/>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Remember to click SAVE button to persist the changes made.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To modify, select the required service sub-component/service component/team, expand the collector 
configuration box and make your changes, and click SAVE button.
